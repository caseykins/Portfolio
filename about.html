            <p>I am a full-stack software developer that enjoys solving problems, creating systems, increasing efficiency, and working in front-end design. With years of experience in bio-tech and electrical work, I possess strong problem solving skills, acute attention to detail, and determination to get the job done well. I enjoy troubleshooting and seeing projects from start to finish, never settling to do less than my best. My goal is to create intuitive and relevant apps that enrich the usersâ€™ experience.</p>
